"Fore!" is the traditional call made by a golfer who has hit an errant shot, to warn players on the same or adjacent holes who may be endangered by said shot.  ForeScore is the beginning of an app to help myself and other golf enthusiasts keep track of their progress in the sport by logging their scores, and eventually by providing statistical analysis of their tendencies.

##### Getting Started

The user may login on the landing screen, and afterwards will need to add golf courses where they've played in the past in order to begin posting their rounds & scores. 


##### Next Steps

For my next steps, I want to provide what I'd call downward depth to the app, so that on a particular round of golf you could view your score by hole, in addition to common statistics, such as total putts, greens-in-regulation, fairways hit, penalties, and then afterwards categories for common mishit shots - short/long/right/left.  The app would be transitioned to mobile at this point so that you can add your stats to your round as you play.
